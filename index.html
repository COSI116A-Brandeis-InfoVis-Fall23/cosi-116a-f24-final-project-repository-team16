    <h1>Project Team 16: Good Health and Well-Being, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Bofan Chen</strong>, <strong>Jason Lin</strong>, <strong>Stan Wan</strong>, <strong>Abby Zhang</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>In today's world, understanding and promoting good health and well-being has become increasingly important. Our visualization aims to explore key health indicators and their relationships across different regions and demographics, helping users identify patterns and disparities in global health outcomes. </em></p>

    <p><em>Through interactive data visualization, we seek to answer critical questions about healthcare access, life expectancy trends, and factors influencing population health. This tool will help policymakers, researchers, and the public better understand the complex landscape of global health and well-being.</em></p>

    
    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <p><em>Move your mouse through the world map to see its SDG score and ranking. Click on any country on the world map to navigate its domestic Maternal Mortality Ratio for two decades.</em></p>

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>
    
    <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>
    
    <video controls width="100%">
      <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is

    </video>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Higher ranking of SDG score found in European countries, Australia and North America. Asian and South American Countries are moderate. African countries are relatively lower. A slightly downward trend of Maternal Mortality Ratio World-wide, while exceptions exist.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <h3>High-Level Tasks (Goals and Overall Purpose)</h3>
    <p><em>Understand SDG Performance:
      Explore Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) scores at a global and country level.
      Analyze Maternal Mortality Trends:
      Assess historical changes in Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) from 2000 to 2020.
      Facilitate Data-Driven Decisions:
      Enable policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to identify patterns and support sustainable development efforts.</em></p>
      <h3>Medium-Level Tasks (Processes and Interactions)</h3>
      <p><em>Interactive Exploration of the World Map:
      
      Allow users to click on countries to view their SDG scores dynamically.
      Highlight selected countries for focus.
      Temporal Analysis of MMR:
      
      Display country-specific maternal mortality trends in a line chart over time (2000â€“2020).
      Compare year-over-year changes.
      Cross-Country Comparisons:
      
      Enable users to compare SDG performance and MMR trends between multiple countries.
      Provide contextual insights for better understanding of disparities.</em></p>
      <h3>Low-Level Tasks (Specific Data Visualization Functions)</h3>
      <p><em>World Map Visualization:
      
      Display SDG scores through color gradients for clear global comparisons.
      Enable responsive interactivity for clicking on countries.
      Line Chart for MMR Trends:
      
      Plot maternal mortality data for selected countries.
      Include axes, labels, tooltips, and legends for better readability.
      Allow zooming or filtering specific time periods.
      Dynamic Interactivity:
      
      Update the line chart in real-time based on the country selected on the map.
      Provide hover-over tooltips showing values for SDG scores.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>We decided to choose Abby's map sketch as out visualization type from our initial ideas.</em></p>

    <img src="images/Abby_sketches.png" alt="Abby's sketch">

    <p><em>In our sketch draft, we determined the main components of our visualization - an interactive map with a line chart.</em></p>

    <img src="images/sketch_draft.png" alt="sketch draft">

    <p><em>Differed from the sketches, we have utilized the color scale to the map for more direct demonstration of the healthcare levels between countries.</em></p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>We believed that we have attained our goal of helping the public better understand the landscape of global health and well-being through an interactive visualization. The job could not have been finished without any of the team member's contribution. Meanwhile, improvements can be made if more time is allowed, and we will expect to add more indicators or metrics and to identify outliers to provide a more comprehensive illustration of the topic for our viewers.</em></p>
